It only involves a few `curls` and `clones` - the total process takes only a few minutes to make the tool you revolve your life around *just right*.\n\n## Steps\n1. Install iTerm2 from [this link](http://iterm2.com) or use `brew cask install iterm2`.\n2. Open iTerm2 and install Oh My Zsh by curling:\n```\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n```\n3. Open your `~/.zshrc` file (I like using vim with `vim ~/.zshrc`) and add the line:\n```\nZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\"\n```\n4. Install [this font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Meslo%20Slashed/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20for%20Powerline.ttf). \n5. Open iTerm (your icons will look funky) and *cmd-i* to open your Preferences. Under Text select your font to be *Meslo LG M Reguar for Powerline*.\n6. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) using \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes\n``` \nto save all the schemas somewhere. \n7. Pick your favourite theme from the repo and *cmd-i* to open Preferences and under *Colors* click *Color Presets* import the scheme you like from `iTerm2-Color-Schemes/schemes` (you can also tweak the colors at this tab).\n8. Save your present under *General*.\n\n\nHopefully this points you in the right direction to customize your CLI to your liking. Reading through the commented out lines in `~/.zshrc` will help you understand what is in your control.","html":"<h1>Your Terminal and You</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Tutorial to Customizing Your Shell</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We all have a love/hate relationship with our CLI, no matter what operating system.
