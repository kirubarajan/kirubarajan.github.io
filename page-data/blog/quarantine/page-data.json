There's no need to pile on unnecessary stress during a global pandemic. Generally, I think goals themselves can  be a way to set yourself up to fail and never look back so instead I like to set myself **themes**. Individual acts, no matter how small, contribute to my theme (whether it be for the New Year or time in quarantine), and it's more rewarding to look back on a series of successes rather than the missing gaps in my \"goals\".\n\nMy themes for the next few weeks are **comfort** and **exploration**.\n\nComfort is purely about indulgence.
