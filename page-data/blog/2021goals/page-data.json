From running $X$ kilometers to learning a new programming language, there's nothing wrong in highlighting your aspirations.\n\nHowever, whenever I write a list like that on my blog, I find myself either being too ambitious or inadvertently value signalling. So this year, I'm going to try something different: writing a list of things to *not do*. \n\nLet's call these **anti-goals**.\n\n## Anti-Goals\n\n#### 1. Have a never-ending list of books to read.\n\nBonus points if you buy more books before finishing the ones you're currently reading. The actual reflections and musings don't matter as much as the length of your Goodreads list and the amount of overlap with Twitter's current \"thought leader\".\n\n#### 2. Prioritize schoolwork over a well-rounded senior year.\n\nIt's your last semester so why not finish strong with a good GPA? It's a pandemic anyway, so this very well could be your only productive use of time (beyond launching a SubStack or starting a new company).\n\n#### 3. Earn to give instead of giving.\n\nInstead of getting your hands dirty, use the time you save to earn more money! Donate a fraction of that instead (say $Y$% of it) and pat yourself on the back for being responsible during a pandemic.\n\n#### 4. Doom-scroll into Twitter oblivion every day. \n\nHow else will you simultaneously know *every single thing* that occurs in the world? As a citizen of the 21st century, it is your responsibility to do so, and have a tweetable opinion on everything as well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis post felt a bit cheeky to write, but all of my anti-goals are things I've been guilty of over the past few years. Sometimes (especially during a pandemic), it's nice to not expect too much from yourself and to let momentum take its course. Your best offense can just be a good defense.\n\nCheers to a marginally better year!","html":"<h1>Anti-Goals for 2021</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Things to hopefully avoid this year</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>2020 definitely sucked, so naturally we all have incredible expectations for 2021.</p>\n<p>Most blog posts I've seen on goal-setting for 2021 are a list of normative statements for what to do within the following year.
