So in early May,\nI began to get a little worried about a pitiful celebration alone in my room or something. Even on the day of, my relatives and friends\nwould jokingly refer to a *\"Quarantine Birthday\"*, which I'm sure other people who've gone through birthdays in 2020 can relate to. However, this birthday may have been my favourite yet and I'm pretty sure quarantine had something to do with it. In this blog post, I would like to share why my otherwise mundane celebration actually was the most memorable.\n\nThe day started at midnight with my sister dropping a laptop in my room with my first ever surprise birthday party over Zoom. I'm really grateful for\neverybody hopping on the call, and it was really heartwarming to see (I was also genuinely surprised), even if everybody had embarrasing Zoom backgrounds of me.\nGiven that the call included a never seen before combination of my friends from both Canada and the US, it could only have been done over video chat!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IXYVAI9.jpg)\n\nI started the morning after a late night with some croissants (my favourite breakfast food) and a cup of freshly roasted Kenyan coffee from West End Roasters. The coffee was so good I ended up having another two cups by the end of the day!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EMYY0KL.png)\n\nNext, I checked the feed-levels for the bird-feeder I recently put up in my backyard. I was relieved\nto see that after only one day, bird traffic was non-zero! I quickly called my family to remind them\nof the new bird-feeder - they let me bother them because it was my birthday.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CeCkTxm.jpg)\n\nFor lunch, I picked up takeout from my favourite restaurant, [Lazeez](https://lazeezshawarma.com/): a Mississauga staple \nthat you either vehemently love or hate. After 3 months without takeout, it was certainly love that I was feeling. Plus,\nmy sister made a very tasty ice cream cake (I can't eat normal cake) to really sell the birthday vibe.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/clE1J7r.jpg)\n\nAfter forcing my family to watch The Dark Knight Rises with me (in all of its three-hour glory), I invited my \nfriends over for a social distancing party in my backyard, complete with masks and gloves provided. We tried our best to\nadhere to Ontario social distancing standards, with nobody coming inside the house.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jpqCdsb.jpg)\n\nSince moving to the US from Canada at the beginning of university, I've thought about what my 21st birthday would be like, especially\nwith how big of a deal Americans make it.
